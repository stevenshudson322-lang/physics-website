        <h2>Forces - How Objects Change Motion Through Interactions and Newtons Three laws</h2>

        <p><strong>UNIT 2 Forces:</strong></p>

        <p>Forces are the interactions between objects that change their motion, energy, or shape. The simplest way to think of a force is as a <strong>push</strong> or a <strong>pull</strong>. 
        A force is the result of an interaction between two objects. Now, forces can be described as a contact or non contact force. A contact being something like force of friction and a non contact 
        being something strong force that holds subatomic particles together. For now lets not worry about all these types of forces, as youll learn about the basic ones on this page 
        and others on later units like electicity and magnetism. Lastly, during this unit youll learn about different types of forces, force diagrams, vectors, newtons 3 laws, and how to solve equations.
        Forces are a very important unit that Will show up in later units, so make sure you understand them</p>

        <p><h3>Terms:</h3></p>

        <p><strong>(F) Force</strong> - An interaction between two or more objects that causes a change in motion, energy or shape. Measured in Newtons (kg x m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
            <p>Equation: F = ma (F = force(newtons), m = mass(kg), a = acceleration(m/s<sup>2</sup>))</p>

        <p><strong>(M) Mass</strong> - The amount of matter in an objects regardless of where it is located, measured in kilograms. *Note: Mass is not the same as an objects weigth.</p>

        <p><strong>Weight</strong> - The force of gravity acing on a object, measured in newtons.</p>

            <p>Equation: W = mg (W = weigth(newtons), m = mass(kg), g = gravity(9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>))</p>
        
        
        <h3>Newtons first law of Motion</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Newtons First Law (Law of Inertia)</strong> - Newtons first law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.
        This law is essentiall to the way that we think about forces and motion. It tells us that an object will remian at rest or at a constant veloicyt if there is no net force on it. However if there is a net force 
        acting on it, the object will accelerate in the direction of the net force.  

        <p><strong>Newtons Second Law (Law of Acceleration)</strong> - Newtons second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is direcelty proportional to the force acting on it.</p>
            
            <p> Equation: F<sub>NET</sub> = ma (F<sub>NET</sub> = net force(Newtons), m = mass (kilograms), a = acceleration(m/s<sup>2</sup>) )</p>

        <p>This law is crucial to deriving the motion of objects and determining the acceleration on them and will be your best friend throughout this unit.</p>

        <p><strong>Newtons Third Law (Law of Action-Reaction)</strong> - Newtons third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. What this law means is that when there is a force or action done on something 
        there is an equal force acting back. This may sound strange and thats becasue it is not typically intuitive, so think of it like this. When you hit a ball with a bat, the ball is also hitting the bat. Or when if you hit a wall, 
        the wall also hits you. This is why it would hurt if you punch a wall, or when you push water back with your arm as you swim it pushes you forweard.</p>

        <p><h3>Types of Forces:</h3></p>

        <p><strong>Gravitational Force (F<sub>g</sub>)</strong> - The force between two objects due to their masses.</p>

        <p><strong>Frictional Force (F<sub>F</sub>)</strong> - The force that opposes the motion of an object sliding against a surface.</p>

        <p><strong>Normal Force (F<sub>N</sub>)</strong> - The force exerted by a surface perpendicular to it to support objects.</p>

        <p><strong>Force Tension (F<sub>T</sub>)</strong> - The force transmitted by a rope, string, or cable when it is pulled by forces acting on it.</p>

        <p><strong>Applied Force (F<sub>A</sub>)</strong> - The force directly applied to an object through a push or pull.</p>

        <p><strong>Force Drag (F<sub>D</sub>)</strong> - The force that opposes an object motion when traveling through a fluid.</p>

        
        <h3>Free body diagrams:</h3>

        <p>Free body diagrams are a way to represent forces acting on an object to easily determine the net forces exerted on them. Thye consisit of a box, representing the system of object with the forces acting upon it. Forces are represented by
        vectors shwoing the direction and magntiude of the force. If you do not know about or havent learned about vectors, click on this link to learn about them first: <a href="vectors.html">Click Here</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p><em>Directions: Determine if there is a net force and if the object is at rest or in motion.</em></p>
