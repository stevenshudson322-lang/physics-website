        <h2>Forces - How Objects Change Motion Through Interactions and Newtons Three laws</h2>

        <p><strong>UNIT 2 Forces:</strong></p>

        <p>Forces are the interactions between objects that change their motion, energy, or shape. The simplest way to think of a force is as a <strong>push</strong> or a <strong>pull</strong>. 
        A force is the result of an interaction between two objects. Now, forces can be described as acontact or non contact force. A contact being something like force of friction and a non contact 
        being something strong force that holds subatomic particles together. For now lets not worry about all these types of forces, as youll learn about the basic ones on this page 
        and others on later units like electicity and magnetism. Lastly, during this unit youll learn about different types of forces, force diagrams, vectors, newtons 3 laws, and how to solve equations.</p>

        <p><h3>Terms:</h3></p>

        <p><strong>(F) Force</strong> - An interaction between two or more objects that causes a change in motion, energy or shape. Measured in Newtons (kg x m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>

        <p><strong>Contact Force</strong> - A force that requires phsyicsal contact between the objects</p>

        <p><strong>Non-Contact Force</strong>- A force that does not require physical contact between the objects, such as gravity.</p>

        <p><strong>(M) Mass</strong> - The amount of matter in an objects regardless of where it is located, measured in kilograms. *Note: Mass is not the same as an objects weigth.</p>

        <p><strong>Weight</strong> - The force of gravity acing on a object, measured in newtons.</p>

            <p>Equation: W = mg (W = weigth(newtons), m = mass(kg), g = gravity(9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>))</p>
        
        <p><strong>Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)</strong> - An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced 
        force.</p>

        <p><strong>Newton's Second Law (Law of Acceleration)</strong> - The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net 
        force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.</p>

            <p>Equation: F = ma (F = force(newtons), m = mass(kg), a = acceleration(m/s<sup>2</sup>))</p>
        
        <p><strong>Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)</strong> - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. *This may be tricky to think about at first, but think about it like this, If you smack a 
        wall with your hand youexter a force onto the wall, but the wall also exerts the same amount of force onto tyour hand. That is why it would hurt your hand it it turns red after. This law becomes especiialy importnat 
        in the next unit inlcuding momentum and impulses</p>
