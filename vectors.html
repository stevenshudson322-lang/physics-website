    <h2>Vectors - Direction and Magnitude</h2>

    <p><strong>UNIT Vectors</strong></p>

    <p>Vectors are a simple and a frequent part of physics, especially when drawing free body diagrams, though they will also so up 
    in other units like rotational motion and Electromagnetism.</p>

    <p>Vectors are very simple yet very important. To help with this practice problems specifically about vectors and adding vectors 
    will be provided below. Now, enough talk of that; lets actually learn what a vector is.</p>

    <p><strong>What A Vector Is: (Vector = how much + which way)</strong></p>

    <p>A vector is a quantity that has both a direction and magnitude. This means that a vector has a direction to it, 
    up and to the right being positive, and down and to the left being negative.

    Having a magnitude just measures the quantity of the vector, how big it is. 
    Magnitude would be something like a force having a value of 5 newtons or a object having a velocity of 40 m/s.</p>
    
    <p>This may be a touch confusing so think of this example: Imaging you are pushing a toy car it matters how hard you push it, and what direction you push it. 
    A vector is how hard you push it and what direction you push it. Even if you push it just as hard, puhsing to the left will be different 
    from puhing to the rigth.</p>
